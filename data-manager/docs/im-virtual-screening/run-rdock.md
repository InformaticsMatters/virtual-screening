# Job: run-rdock

This describes how to run the `run-rdock` job from the `virtual screening` category in the `im-virtual-screening` collection.

## What the job does

This job runs the rDock docking tool, generating poses of the candidate molecules in the binding site of the receptor.
Note that this job is potentially very computationally intensive, runs in parallel and can take several hours to complete.

## Implementation details

This job is implemented as a [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow.

* Nextflow workflow: [rdock-docking.nf](/rdock-docking.nf])
* Job definition: `jobs.run-rdock` in [im-virtual-screening.yaml](/data-manager/im-virtual-screening.yaml)

## How to run the job

### Inputs

* **Candidate ligands to process**: the molecules to dock in SDF format, typically generated by the 
[assemble-conformers](assemble-conformers.md) job.
* **Prepared receptor**: the prepared receptor in MOL2 format.
* **rDock configuration**: the rDock configuration file (.prm file), either manually generated or prepared by the
  [prepare-rdock](prepare-rdock.md) job.
* **Cavity definition**: the rDock cavity definition file (.as file) generated with the *rbcavity* program typically 
  using the [prepare-rdock](prepare-rdock.md) job.

### Options
* **Number of dockings**: the number of poses to generate for each candidate molecule.
