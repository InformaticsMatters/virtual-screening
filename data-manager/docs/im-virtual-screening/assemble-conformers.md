This describes how to run the `assemble-conformers` job from the `virtual screening` category in the `im-virtual-screening` collection.

## What the job does

This job collects the conformers generated by the [enumerate-candidates](enumerate-candidates.md) or 
[generate-low-energy-conformers](generate-low-energy-conformers.md) jobs into a single SDF file that can be used as input for virtual screening.

The input is a file containing the molecules that need to be collected, typically the input of the 
[prep-enum-conf-lists](prep-enum-conf-lists.md) job that was used to generate the molecules needing enumeration and 3D conformer generation.

## Implementation details

Python module: [/assemble_conformers.py]()
Job definition: `jobs.assemble-conformers` in [/data-manager/virtual-screening.yaml]()

## How to run the job

### Inputs
**Molecules to assemble**: the input molecules to assemble
**Directory with sharded data**: the directory with the sharded data (typically `molecules/sha256`)

### Options
**Filename for SDF output**: the name of the output SDF file
**Conformer mode**: `single` (for single enumerated conformer) or  `low-energy` for the multiple low energy conformers
**Exclude base molecules**: Do not include the base molecule
**Exclude enumerated tautomers**: Do not include enumerated tautomers
**Exclude enumerated microstates**: Do not include microstates

### Outputs

The output is a SD file containing the 3D conformers that were specified
