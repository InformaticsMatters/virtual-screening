# Job: oddt-score-interactions

This describes how to run the `oddt-score-interactions` job from the `virtual screening` category in the `im-virtual-screening` collection.

## What the job does

This job runs some more sophisticated re-scoring functions on binding poses and calculates the interactions the poses 
make with the protein. This uses functions in the ODDT toolkit.

It is typically used to provide a more detailed assessment of poses generated by docking tools such as the 
[run-rdock](run-rdock.md) or [run-smina](run-smina.md) jobs.

## Implementation details

This job is implemented as a [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow.

* Python module: [oddt_interactions.py](/oddt_interactions.py)
* Nextflow workflow: [oddt-interactions.nf](/oddt-interactions.nf)
* Job definition: `jobs.oddt-score-interactions` in [im-virtual-screening.yaml](/data-manager/im-virtual-screening.yaml)
* About ODDT: https://github.com/oddt/oddt

## How to run the job

### Inputs

* **Candidate ligands to process**: the poses to assess in SDF format.
* **Prepared receptor**: the receptor into which the poses were docked in PDB format.

### Options
